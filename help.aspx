<h3><a name="how"></a>How do I login?</h3>
<p>Use you campus username and password to login. This is the same username and password you use to login at the computers or Webmail.</p>
<h3>I don't have a campus username and password</h3>
<p>If you haven't set-up your username and password, you need to visit the Student Technology Help Desk on the second floor of the Kellogg Library. Even if you already have a library barcode, you still need a username and password. </p>

<h3>Why can't I use my library barcode and PIN?</h3>
<p> In order to make the Library easier to  use, all of our systems now use the campus username and password for authentication. Because of this switch, Interlibrary Loan can no longer accept barcodes and PINs.</p>
<h3><a name="pac"></a>It says the Library doesn't have a record of me in the library user database. What's wrong?</h3>
<p> This is most likely a problem on our end. We are automatically alerted to these errors, and will attempt to resolve them, and e-mail you a response, as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Library Systems personnel are only available Monday -- Friday, 8:00 AM -- 5:00 PM. If you run into this problem outside of those hours, we will attempt to solve the problem as soon as possible the next business day. </p>
